# Chapter 17: Control Flow and Loops

Welcome to Chapter 17! In this chapter, you'll learn how to make your Python programs intelligent and efficient by teaching them to make decisions and repeat actions automatically.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Make decisions in code** using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- **Use pattern matching** with Python's modern `match-case` syntax
- **Automate repetition** using `for` and `while` loops
- **Control loop behavior** with `break`, `continue`, and loop-else patterns
- **Combine decisions and loops** to solve complex problems
- **Describe your intent clearly** so AI can help you write correct control flow logic
- **Validate your logic** by testing edge cases and understanding execution flow

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have completed:

- **Chapter 13**: Introduction to Python (variables, basic syntax, running programs)
- **Chapter 14**: Data Types (int, float, str, bool, type hints)
- **Chapter 15**: Operators, Keywords, and Variables (comparison operators, logical operators)
- **Chapter 16**: Strings and Type Casting (string manipulation, input(), type conversion)

You should be comfortable:
- Writing simple Python programs with variables
- Using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Asking your AI companion to explain concepts and generate code

## Time Estimate

**Total chapter time**: 4-5 hours

This is an intermediate-level chapter (A2-B1 CEFR proficiency). Take breaks between lessons and practice with your AI companion.

## Chapter Structure

This chapter has 5 progressive lessons:

| Lesson | Title | CEFR Level | Time | What You'll Build |
|--------|-------|-----------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | Making Decisions with Conditionals | A2 | 45-60 min | Age verifier, grade calculator |
| 2 | Pattern Matching with match-case | A2-B1 | 50-65 min | Menu system, HTTP status handler |
| 3 | Repetition with Loops | A2-B1 | 55-70 min | Countdown timer, number sum calculator |
| 4 | Controlling Loops | A2-B1 | 55-70 min | Search function, retry logic |
| 5 | Nested Control Structures | B1 | 60-75 min | Multiplication table, game grid logic |

## Learning Approach

This chapter follows the **AI-Native Learning** pattern:

1. **Book teaches foundational concepts** (Tier 1): Simple patterns you'll use every day
2. **AI companion handles complex patterns** (Tier 2): Advanced scenarios you specify, AI executes
3. **You validate and learn**: Test code, explore edge cases, understand why it works

Every lesson ends with a **"Try With AI"** section where you practice:
- **Recall**: Remember key concepts
- **Understand**: Trace execution and explain behavior
- **Apply**: Generate code for new problems
- **Analyze/Evaluate**: Identify edge cases and compare approaches

## Success Metrics

You'll know you've mastered this chapter when you can:

- ✅ Explain when to use `if/elif/else` vs `match-case`
- ✅ Choose between `for` and `while` loops for different scenarios
- ✅ Trace the execution of nested control structures
- ✅ Write conditional logic that handles real-world decision problems
- ✅ Use `break`, `continue`, and loop-else patterns appropriately
- ✅ Describe control flow intent clearly enough for AI to generate working code
- ✅ Validate logic by testing boundary values and edge cases

## Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.14+** (Python 3.10+ for Lesson 2: match-case)
- **AI Tool**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT (your choice)
- **Editor**: VSCode or any Python-compatible editor
- **Package Manager**: `uv` (for running code examples)

## How to Use This Chapter

1. **Read each lesson sequentially** (don't skip ahead - concepts build on each other)
2. **Type and run all code examples** (copy-paste works, but typing builds muscle memory)
3. **Complete "Try With AI" sections** (this is where real learning happens)
4. **Test edge cases** (what happens with negative numbers? empty inputs? zero?)
5. **Ask your AI companion questions** (it's there to help - use it!)

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Read the Red Flags section** in each lesson (common errors and fixes)
2. **Ask your AI companion**: "What's wrong with this code?" or "Why doesn't this work?"
3. **Review prerequisite chapters** if concepts feel unfamiliar
4. **Take a break** and come back with fresh eyes
