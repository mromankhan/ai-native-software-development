## Directory Structure Reference

**For complete directory structure specification**: See **`specs/book/directory-structure.md`**

This document provides chapter titles and topics. For exact file paths, naming conventions, and folder organization, consult `directory-structure.md`.

**Quick Reference**:
- Chapters are **directories** (not files): `book-source/docs/NN-Part-Name/NN-chapter-name/`
- Each chapter contains lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Chapter folders use **lowercase-with-hyphens**
- Part folders use **Title-Case-With-Hyphens**

**Examples** (updated structure):
- Chapter 1: `book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-ai-development-revolution/`
- Chapter 13: `book-source/docs/04-SDD-RI-Fundamentals/13-specification-driven-development-fundamentals/`
- Chapter 16: `book-source/docs/05-Python-Fundamentals/16-python-uv-package-manager/`

## Using This Index

**When creating a chapter**:
1. Find the chapter number and title in this index
2. Use the filename from this index
3. Place file in the correct part folder
4. Set `sidebar_position: [N]` in YAML frontmatter to the chapter number
5. Match the title exactly in frontmatter
6. Reference `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` for formatting guidelines

**Version**: Updated 2025-11-26 — Split Part 10 into Part 10 (Frontends) and Part 11 (Realtime/Voice), renumbered Parts 11-12 to Parts 12-13, added Part 13 (Physical AI).
